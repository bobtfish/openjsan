=head1 Where do I Start?

Install the Perl module Module::Build from CPAN.

  sudo perl -MCPAN -e'install "Module::Build"'

You very much need to rename the directories and files
to fit your distribution's name and set of libraries.

Start by renaming the JSAN.Example directory to "Your.Namespace".

You will have to rename the test files. You will probably
have to download and import Test.Simple into tests/lib as well.

You will have to write your code, probably replacing all the
function and method names in JSAN.Example.

You will have to rewrite the documentation to contain
your name and information.

You will need to alert Build.PL to contain the proper
information for your distribution.

You may choose to remove this document, however you don't have to.

=head1 How do I Package this for JSAN?

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build manifest
  ./Build dist
