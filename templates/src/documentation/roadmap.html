[% META title = 'Documentation - Project Roadmap' %]

<p>
  The official roadmap of things that need to be completed, and their
  perceived status at the time this document was last updated
  ([% page.date %]), and how you can help. Given the pace things are
  moving at, this roadmap does not refer to specific dates for addition.
</p>

<h2>The Vision</h2>

<p>Although the JSAN will ultimately be different to the CPAN, the CPAN
  infrastructure has had 10 years to mature and evolve to it's current state, and
  serves as a good blueprint for anyone wanting to implement anything
  similar.

<h2>The JSAN Components</h2>

<p>This list is probably not complete, things are moving very quickly and some of this may get a little out of date. If there is something you want to do,
  bring it up on <a href="/community/lists.html#jsan-devel">the JSAN Development</a>
  mailing list.</p>
<p>Although there aren't fixed milestones as such, you could consider Milestone 1 to be a working JSAN (in any form) where packages can be uploaded, installed, and used. This has been completed.</p>
<p>The next step, Milestone 2 if you will, mainly involves the completion of all items not marked as Future, and rounds out JSAN to be much more complete, flexible and rubust.</p>

<h2>How can you help? </h2>
<h3>Create an Import System for RT</h3>
<p>
  Create a mechanism by which I can run an RT instance that has a queue
  for every distribution on JSAN. The idea is to have a centralized place
  to report and monitor bugs and features for the JavaScript on JSAN.
</p>

<h3>Create an Authentication Scheme for RT</h3>

<p>
  All SVN Committers should have full access to the Internal RT instance.
  It would be great to have an authentication system that would
  look the user up in the SVN auth basic table and authenticate her
  credentials against it. Otherwise, the user is a guest.
</p>

<p>
  I have some code that can do the authentication against the SVN
  auth table already.
</p>

<h3>Create a Mirror</h3>

<p>
  Fill in our global network. Find out how to be
  <a href="/community/mirrors.html">a mirror</a> for JSAN.
</p>

<h3>Writing Documentation</h3>

<p>
  Open JSAN could use some good documentation on writing excellent classes
  and function libraries. The documentation should include support for the
  JSAN library and example tests using the Test.Simple distribution.
</p>

<h3>Promote JSAN</h3>

<p>
  Get the word out on your blog, news site, at work, or just use some of
  our <a href="/community/promote.html">ideas</a> to promote the
  project.
</p>
