<h1>Installing JSAN Libraries Locally</h1>

<h2>Installing the JSAN Shell</h2>

<p>
  The JSAN Shell can be used to ease the installation of JSAN code.
  It is distributed on CPAN, but you can also download it here.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="JSAN-0.07.tar.gz">Download the JSAN Shell</a>
</p>

<p>
  However, it is recommended that you install this software from CPAN
  because the CPAN shell will manage the Perl module dependencies
  required to get your shell to run. To install from CPAN, run the following
  shell command.
</p>

<pre>
perl -MCPAN -e'install "JSAN"'
</pre>

<h2>Updating your JSAN Index</h2>

<p>
You must run the <em>index</em> command. Run the following shell command.
</p>

<pre>
jsan index
</pre>

<h2>Installing Libraries</h2>

<p>
  Now you're ready to install some JSAN libraries.
</p>

<p>
  The JSAN Shell does not assume a particular location for installing JSAN
  libraries. You must specify your installation prefix or JSAN won't
  install anything. There are two ways to do that. The first is with
  the <code>--prefix</code> option. The second is by setting the
  <code>JSAN_PREFIX</code> environment variable. Here are examples of each.
  The environment example is based on valid Bash Shell syntax.
</p>

<pre>
jsan --prefix=/usr/local/js
JSAN_PREFIX=/usr/local/js jsan
</pre>

<p>
Now run the install command. This time I'm using the <code>-p</code>
prefix option short cut.
</p>

<pre>
shell> jsan -p /usr/local/js install JSAN
/dist/c/cw/cwest/JSAN-0.04.tar.gz -> /tmp/xkAU2XT95W/JSAN-0.04.tar.gz
Unpacking JSAN-0.04.tar.gz
Installing libraries to /usr/local/js
</pre>
